## 📊 Student Performance Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Student Performance Analysis** project! This project involves performing detailed data analysis on a dataset of student scores across three subjects – **Math**, **Science**, and **English** – to extract meaningful insights and answer various real-world questions.

---

### 🔍 Objective

To analyze students' academic performance and derive insights like total scores, top performers, grading, subject-wise analysis, and consistency in marks using Python and pandas.

---

### 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains students' marks in three subjects:  
- `Math`  
- `Science`  
- `English`  

Each row represents one student and their scores in these subjects.

---

### ✅ Key Features & Tasks Completed

1. **Reading and Accessing the Dataset**
   - Loaded the CSV file using pandas for processing.

2. **Total Marks Calculation**
   - Calculated total marks for each student across all subjects.

3. **Topper of the Class 🏆**
   - Identified the student with the highest total marks.

4. **Lowest Scorer**
   - Found the student with the lowest total marks.

5. **Sorted Mean Marks**
   - Calculated the mean score for each subject and sorted them to evaluate overall difficulty.

6. **Best Teaching Subject 🧑‍🏫**
   - Determined the subject with the highest average score (indicating effective teaching).

7. **Number of Students**
   - Counted the total number of students present in the dataset.

8. **Highest & Lowest Scores per Subject**
   - Retrieved subject-wise highest and lowest marks.

9. **Students with Total Marks > 250**
   - Found how many students scored more than 250 in total.

10. **Grading System 📝**
    - Added a new `Grade` column based on total marks:
      - `A` → ≥ 270  
      - `B` → 240–269  
      - `C` → 200–239  
      - `D` → < 200

11. **Sorted by Grade**
    - Sorted students in descending order based on their grades and total marks.

12. **Top 3 Performers per Subject**
    - Extracted top 3 students in **Math**, **Science**, and **English**.

13. **Pass/Fail Status**
    - Created a column to check if the student passed in all subjects (≥40 marks in each).

14. **Most Consistent Student 🎯**
    - Identified the student with the smallest difference between their highest and lowest subject scores (most consistent performance).
